LEPTON CMS Installation Instructions
============================================

First of all, you must have a webserver/webspace with following requirements:

    * Minimum of 20 MB webspace (extended installations need more)
    * PHP 5.2. or higher
    * MySQL 5.0 or higher
    * PHP Safe Mode = off
    * Activated PHP Session Support

PHP and MySQL installed correctly. 
Once you have got that, place the "upload" folder somewhere on 
your server, probably under the document root:
e.g. /documentroot/upload

This should be accessed by an address something like this:
e.g. http://your_domain.tld/upload/

If you want no "upload" directory please upload all files and folders directly to your root.

Now create a blank MySQL database, commonly called "lepton".
Please use collation "utf8_unicode_ci" if possible.

Once that is all done simple run the
install script from your browser:
e.g. http://your_domain.tld/upload/install 
or 
http://your_domain.tld/install 
if you don't want "upload" directory.

Fill in the form, submit and if all details are correct, you should be taken to LEPTON Login Page.

Have fun!
