LEPTON
========

Official repository for LEPTON

Since we went to gitHub there are some changes that should be explained a little bit more detailed.

1. We will now use the documentation to inform about modifications of LEPTON CMS, developers as well as agencies and users. We are sure these informations are helpful.
http://doc.lepton-cms.org

2. Please don't use the repository for productive installations, because this is a developers SVN. 
https://github.com/LEPTON-project/LEPTON
You can download all available packages on our homepage 
http://lepton-cms.org
in the download area!

3. Please report all issues from current stable release to issue tracker in the svn:
https://github.com/LEPTON-project/LEPTON/issues
but please have a look on our forum
http://forum.lepton-cms.org/
and also on the closed issues
https://github.com/LEPTON-project/LEPTON/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
before you post a new issue.
Thanks.
