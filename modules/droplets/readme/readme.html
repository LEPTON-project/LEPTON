		Droplets are small chunks of php code (just like the code module) that can be included in your template or any other content section. <br />
		Including a droplet is done by encapsulating the droplet name in double brackets. <br />
		If you want to use the droplet &quot;ModifiedWhen&quot; (to show the last modified date and time of the current page) you only need to add <b>[[ModifiedWhen]]</b> to your template or WYSIWYG contentpage. <br />
		<br />
		You are encouraged to create your own droplets and share them with the community. <br />
		<br />
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<br />
		Droplets are installed as an admin tool. The installation is done using the normal &quot;Add module&quot; page in the WB backend. <br />
		When the installation is successfull, there is a new tool added to the Admin-Tools menu. <br />
		Clicking the tool will display the current installed droplets, and a button to create your own. <br />
		<br />
		<h3>Getting Droplets</h3>
		<br />
		A fast growing number of Droplets are available for use, you can use the <a href="http://www.websitebakers.com/pages/droplets/official-library.php" target="_new">Official Droplets Library</a> in the AMASP project website, or you can search the WB Forum. <br />
		<br />
		Droplets can be added by copy&amp;paste or, since Version 1.1, by direct upload of an appropriate ZIP file.
		<br />
		<h3>Coding Droplets</h3>
		<br />
		Droplets run in PHP mode, no <font color="#ff0000">&lt;?php</font> or <font color="#ff0000">?&gt;</font> is allowed in the code! If any of these tags are found in the code they will be removed. Your code will not run as expected. <br />
		The droplet code can NOT echo or print data to the output stream directly. The Droplet name is replaced by the return value of the PHP code.<br />
		Example: [[HelloWorld]] <br />
		<br />
		<font color="#ff0000">Wrong code:</font> echo &quot;Hello World&quot;; <br />
		<font color="#339966">Correct code:</font> return &quot;Hello World&quot;; <br />
		<br />
		Take a look at the Droplets that come with the module for examples.<br />
		Since version 0.3 Droplets can modify the complete page content. <br />
		When the Droplet is called, an extra variable ($wb_page_data) is made available. 
		This variable holds all the content of your current generated webpage.
		You can modify any part of this content simply by replacing it in the variable.
    There is no need to return this variable, the Droplet code will process changed
    content automatically.<br /><br />
		
		Since version 0.3 Droplets will check the PHP code you have saved for validity. <br />
		When the code will not execute correctly a red flashing icon
    <img src="../img/invalid.gif" alt="icon" title="invalid droplet code icon" />
    will apear in the backend Droplets list. <br />
		The standard blue icon
    <img src="../img/droplet.png" alt="icon" title="standard droplet icon" />
    
    is no guarantee that the Droplets does what you would expect it to do, it will just tell you if the code is valid PHP code.<br /><br />
		
		Since version 0.3 Droplets you do not need to return any data. When you end your code with <pre>return true;</pre> there will not be an errormessage. The processed Droplet tag will be removed.<br />

		<br />
		<h3>PHP color coding</h3>
		<br />
		The Droplets edit page is ready to use the EditArea module. This module creates a color coded editor for PHP code. EditArea is included with WB, so you don't need to install it.<br />
		<br />
		<h3>Exporting Droplets</h3>
		<br />
		You can backup your complete Droplets archive by clicking on the
		<button disabled="disabled" title="Backup Droplets (Zip)">Backup Droplets (Zip)</button>
		button. This will save all Droplets as single PHP files into a ZIP file. You
		can take this ZIP and	<button disabled="disabled" title="Import">Import</button> it on another
    WB Installation, for example.<br />
    To export a certain list of Droplets, mark the checkbox next to the items
    you wish to backup and click on the <button disabled="disabled" title="Export">Export</button>
    button on the bottom of the list.<br />
		To see a list of all backups you created, click on the
		<button disabled="disabled" title="Backups">Backups</button> button. This button will only
		appear if there really <strong>are</strong> backup files. You can now manage your backups,
		i.e., delete, recover or download them, see how much files (=Droplets) are included,
		and even a list of included files. To see the list, place the mouse pointer on the file
		name; a "tooltip" will appear that shows the files contained in the ZIP.<br />
