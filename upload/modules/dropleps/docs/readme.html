	<strong>The LEPTON DropLEPs module is based on the Droplets module included in
	Website Baker, but completely rewritten and with lots of new features; so the
	name "DropLEPs" means "Droplets made the LEPTON way".</strong><br /><br />
	DropLEPs (or Droplets, we use it vice versa here) are small chunks of php code
	(just like the code module) that can be included in your template or any other
	content section. <br />
	Including a droplet is done by encapsulating the droplet name in double brackets. <br /><br />
	<strong>Example:</strong><br />
	If you want to use the droplet &quot;LoginBox&quot;, you only need to add
	<strong>[[LoginBox]]</strong> to your template or a WYSIWYG section on your
	page. <br /><br />
	You are encouraged to create your own DropLEPs and share them with the community.
	<br style="clear:left;" /><br />
	
	<h3>Installation</h3><br />
	The DropLEPs module is installed as an Admin Tool. As it is shipped with
	LEPTON >= v2.0, you don't have to install it. If you need to install an
	upgrade, just install it like any other module in the LEPTON backend.<br />

    <h3>Usage</h3><br />
    You need to have the permission to access [Admin Tools] -> [DropLEPS] to
	use this tool.<br />
	Clicking the tool will display the current installed DropLEPs. Depending on
	your permissions, you will be able to
    <ul>
      <li> create (add) your own Droplets;</li>
      <li> edit existing Droplets;</li>
      <li> activate / deactivate Droplets;</li>
      <li> duplicate Droplets (to create a new one based on an existing one);</li>
      <li> delete Droplets;</li>
      <li> import (install) new Droplets;</li>
      <li> export (backup) Droplets;</li>
      <li> manage Droplet permissions;</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<h3>Getting DropLEPs</h3><br />
	A fast growing number of DropLEPs are available for use, you can use the
	<a href="http://www.websitebakers.com/pages/Droplets/official-library.php" target="_new">Droplets Library on the AMASP project website</a>
	 or you can search the Forum. You may use any
	Website Baker Droplet on LEPTON.<br /><br />
	DropLEPs can be added by copy&amp;paste or by direct upload of an appropriate ZIP file.<br />
	
	<h3>Coding DropLEPs</h3><br />
	DropLEPs run in PHP mode, no <span style="color:#ff0000;">&lt;?php</span>
	or <span style="color:#ff0000;">?&gt;</span> is allowed in the code!
	If any of these tags are found in the code they will be removed. Your code
	will not run as expected. <br />
	The droplet code can NOT echo or print data to the output stream directly.
	The Droplet name is replaced by the return value of the PHP code.<br /><br />
	
	<strong>Example: [[HelloWorld]]</strong><br /><br />
	<span style="color:#ff0000;">Wrong code:</span> echo &quot;Hello World&quot;; <br />
	<span style="color:#339966;">Correct code:</span> return &quot;Hello World&quot;; <br /><br />
	Take a look at the DropLEPs that come with the module for examples.<br />
	DropLEPs can modify the complete page content. <br />
	When the Droplet is called, an extra variable ($wb_page_data) is made available.
	This variable holds all the content of your current generated webpage.
	You can modify any part of this content simply by replacing it in the variable.
    There is no need to return this variable, the Droplet code will process changed
    content automatically.<br /><br />

	DropLEPs will check the PHP code you have saved for validity. <br />
	When the code will not execute correctly a red flashing icon
    <img src="../css/img/invalid.gif" alt="icon" title="invalid droplet code icon" />
    will apear in the backend DropLEPs list. <br />
	The standard blue icon
    <img src="../css/img/droplet.png" alt="icon" title="standard droplet icon" />
    is no guarantee that the DropLEPs does what you would expect it to do, it
	will just tell you if the code is valid PHP code.<br /><br />

	DropLEPs do not need to return any data. When you end your code with
	<pre>return true;</pre> there will not be an error message. The processed
	Droplet tag will just be removed.<br /><br />
	
	<h3>PHP color coding</h3><br />
	The DropLEPs edit page is ready to use the EditArea module. This module
	creates a color coded editor for PHP code. EditArea is included with LEPTON,
	so you don't need to install it.<br /><br />
	
	<h3>Exporting DropLEPs</h3><br />
	You can backup your DropLEPs checking the checkboxes of the DropLEPs you
	wish to save and hit <button disabled="disabled" title="Export">Export</button><br />
	This will save all marked DropLEPs as single PHP files into a ZIP file. You
	can take this ZIP and <button disabled="disabled" title="Import">Import</button> it on another
    LEPTON Installation, for example.<br />
	To see a list of all backups you created, click on the
	<button disabled="disabled" title="Backups">Manage Backups</button> button. This button will only
	appear if there really <strong>are</strong> backup files. You can now manage your backups,
	i.e., delete, recover or download them, see how much files (=DropLEPs) are included,
	and even view a list of included files. To see the list, place the mouse pointer on the file
	name; a "tooltip" will appear that shows the files contained in the ZIP.<br /><br /><br />
